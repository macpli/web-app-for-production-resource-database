# Production System Designer

## A lightweight tool for prototyping production systems strucutures

## Overview

The Production System Designer is a tool developed as a practical component for my engineering thesis. This application serves as a simple solution for designing and visualizing production systems. Whether you are a student working on an engineering thesis or a professional involved in production system design, this app simplifies the process and enhances your ability to quickly prototype efficient and well-organized production systems.

## Features

### 1. Design Production System Structures

Easily create a tree list representation of your production system. Organize and structure components and devices to get a clear overview of the entire system hierarchy.

### 2. Layout Drawing

Utilize the intuitive layout drawing feature to design the physical arrangement of the selected production system.

### 3. Report Generation

Generate summary reports for your designed production systems in PDF format. These reports provide valuable insights into the structure, layout, and key components of the system, aiding in documentation and analysis.
